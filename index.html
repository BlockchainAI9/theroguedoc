        <h1>The Rogue Doc - Coming Soon!</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <p>As a root cause detective and Functional Medicine expert, The Rogue Doc, aka Dr. Stuti Gupta, listens to
                your
                life story and health journey for clues and missing pieces. We treat the cause,
                and the disease goes away as a side effect. We don’t look for disease. We look
                for imbalances or dysfunction to correct and help the body get back to what
                it’s supposed to be doing naturally. We step away from the disease paradigm
                (you’re not just the disease or diagnosis you have been labeled) and shift the
                perspective, and this is where the detective work in collaboration with the
                client comes into play for true biohacking and longevity goals. The main goal
                is to restore health for optimal wellness and quality of life. The rest is a
                bonus.</p>
            <p>
                Take a leap of faith into the evidence-based science of personalized lifestyle
                medicine, where your needs are the central focus, and we guide you to eat
                your way to optimal health! A personalized whole-person w(holistic)
                approach using a Functional Medicine Nutrition protocol. We use Food As
                Medicine. It is not a one-size-fits-all approach using synthetic pharmaceutical
                drugs that only suppress and do not treat symptoms. We leave the medication
                discussions to your primary care team of doctors. With The Rogue Doc, we
                tailor your plan considering your unique (Nutri)genomic blueprint (how your
                diet/nutritional status interacts with your genes and impacts your health),
                epigenetics (how your environmental exposures interact with your genes and
                affect your health), lifestyle (mind-body-spirit) including the mental,
                emotional, and social factors, and your utmost concerns; the rest gets taken
                care of as a side effect of your progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                A poor diet, lack of essential nutrients, emotional stress, environmental
                toxins, lack of exercise, disturbed sleep, and other lifestyle issues set the stage for
                chronic disease to develop. We triage your concerns and form a dream team
                collaboration to support you with a program that best suits your readiness and
                budget. We help you implement the changes at a phased pace to guarantee
                success while avoiding overwhelm. We teach you about clean living, cutting-edge modalities, and
                high-quality third-party tested supplements to equip you with all the resources you need to start living
                and feeling like the best version of yourself while transforming the lives around you. Be a catalyst for
                change
                and cause a ripple effect in your collective community by choosing <b><i>you</i></b>, our specialty! The
                rest will follow by your example.
            </p>
